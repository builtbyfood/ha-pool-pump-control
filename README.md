This was written to originally work with SRP's time of use energy plan to control the pump to run low during the highest cost of the day and high speeds during the low cost times of the day. 

I am using this with a Black and Decker variable speed pool pump with the automation panel attached. It is controlled by a Sonoff 4 relay.
